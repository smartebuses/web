                  <p>  Dr. Ignacio Castineiras graduate with a PhD in Computer Science from Complutense University of Madrid in 2014 for his work on multi-paradigm declarative programming systems. After completing his PhD he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at University College Cork (2014–2015). The main goal of the postdoc was to develop a scalable decision support tool to optimise the workload allocation of single and distributed Data Centers for the EU project GENiC (Globally optimised Energy Efficiency Data Centers). Since September 2015, he works as a Lecturer at the Computer Science Department in CIT.

Padraigh Jarvis graduated from Cork Institute of Technology in 2019 with a MSc in Artifical Intelligence and a BSc in Software Development. Since then he has published a paper at an international conference and spent a year working in a research role for a aerospace company. Here he discovered intrest in the use of Artifical Intelligence while he worked on a horizon 2020 project, he also further developing skills in constrant programming, graph-problem optimization, and general software development. Currently a PhD student at University College Cork, Padraigh's research intrests focuses on constraint programming, machine learning, and hybrid reasoning.
