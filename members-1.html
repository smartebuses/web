                     <h1>Project</h1>

                     The implementation of a sustainable and efficient electric transportation network requires addressing multiple concerns such as: limited driving range and battery charging/discharging time. Nowadays, electric buses can travel up to 200KM on a full charge and the charging time varies depending on the technology from a couple of minutes (with fast-charging stations rated at 450 kWh) to hours (with slow-charging stations rated at 30 kWh). In order to address these limitations, we plan to use multiple AI technologies to optimize critical components for the electrification of the public bus transportation system.
 
In this context, SMARTeBuses plans to design and implement new algorithms to optimise critical components for the electrification of the public bus transportation system. First, we will use Big Data and Machine Learning to analyse the current operations of a selected set of bus routes in Ireland. Second, we will identify suitable locations for slow and fast charging stations satisfying a predefined set of power and space capacity constraints. Finally, we will use optimization technology (e.g., constraint programming, mixed integer linear programming, and meta-heuristic search) to provide robust and stable schedules to charge the electric fleet without overloading the national grid and maximizing the use of wind power.

		<h5> Project Coordinator </h5>
                  <p>  Dr. Alejandro Arbelaez  received his PhD in computer science from University of Paris XI for his work on applying learning-based techniques to solve combinatorial problems. After finishing his PhD, he worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Tokyo (2011-13) and University College Cork (2013-16). He is currently a Lecturer in the School of XXX at University College Cork. Dr. Arbelaez is the author of more than 40 research papers in prestigious conferences, journals, international workshops, and 2 two chapters in prestigious books in the field of artificial intelligence.

                  <p>  Dr. Laura Climent  is a Lecturer in the Computer Science department at University College Cork. Before she was a postdoctoral researcher in the Insight Centre for Data Analytics in the University College Cork in Ireland. She obtained her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Universitat Politècnica de València. Dr. Climent’s research interests are within the area of Combinatorial Optimisation and Decision Analytics, including among others sustainability problems and problems with uncertainty. Specifically, she is interested in:Constraint Programming, Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Metaheuristics. Also, their combination with Data Mining and Machine Learning techniques.

                  <p>  Dr. Ignacio Castineiras graduate with a PhD in Computer Science from Complutense University of Madrid in 2014 for his work on multi-paradigm declarative programming systems. After completing his PhD he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at University College Cork (2014–2015). The main goal of the postdoc was to develop a scalable decision support tool to optimise the workload allocation of single and distributed Data Centers for the EU project GENiC (Globally optimised Energy Efficiency Data Centers). Since September 2015, he works as a Lecturer at the Computer Science Department in CIT.
